        Debouncing and throttling are techniques in JavaScript used to control
        how often a function is executed, especially in response to frequent
        events such as scrolling, resizing, or keypresses. They are particularly
        useful for improving performance and user experience.

        <h3>
          Definition: Debouncing ensures that a function is executed only after
          a specified delay has elapsed since the last time it was invoked. It
          prevents a function from being called repeatedly in quick succession.
        </h3>
        <h3>Debouncing Example</h3>
        <button class="increament_btn">Increament</button>
        <p>Button pressed <span class="increament_pressed">0</span> times</p>
        <p>Triggered for <span class="increament_count">0</span> times</p>
        <p class="content">
          Here after clicking the on the increament button, button pressed will
          increase by 1 in every presse but for debouncing if we release the
          press for 8 ms than triggered count will increase by 1.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Use Case:
          <p>
            1- Search bar suggestions (wait for the user to stop typing before
            making a search query).
          </p>
          <p>
            2- Resize event handling (trigger logic only after resizing is
            finished).
          </p>
        </h3>
      </div>

        <h3>
          Definition: Throttling ensures that a function is executed at most
          once every specified interval, even if the event is triggered multiple
          times during that interval.
        </h3>
        <p>Throottling Example</p>
        <button class="increased_btn">Increament</button>
        <p>Button pressed <span class="increased_pressed">0</span> times</p>
        <p>Triggered for <span class="increased_count">0</span> times</p>
        <p class="content">
          Here after clicking the on the increament button, button pressed will
          increase by 1 in every presse but for throttling count will be
          increased in every 8 ms.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>
        Use Case:
        <p>
          1- Scroll event handling (execute a function at regular intervals
          during scrolling).
        </p>
        <p>2- Button click prevention to avoid rapid, repeated submissions.</p>
